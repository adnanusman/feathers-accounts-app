# Simple Accounts using FeathersJS and React
 
## Getting Started

### About

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.

You need Node and Yarn installed.

This is just a simple application that I'm building for my own purposes but is opensource and anyone else can use it as they like or build on it, I'd love to see what you come up with.

This application requires a connection to a remote postgreSQL database, for everything to work you need to have a .env file. More information below.

### ENV FILE REQUIRED

You need to specify a few things in your .env file for the application to work.

DB_STRING should contain your postgreSQL database string.

### INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN IT LOCALLY

Make a clone of the repo.

in the cloned directory, you can start installing the packages:

yarn

followed by running the backend:

yarn run be

followed by running the frontend (in a separate window):

yarn run fe
